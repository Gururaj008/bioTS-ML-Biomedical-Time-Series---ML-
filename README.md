The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques‚Äîparticularly signal embedding, denoising, and classification‚Äîcan be applied to **noisy biomedical time-series data** for meaningful pattern discovery.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Many real-world biomedical signals (e.g., ECG, EEG) are nonlinear, multiscale, and noisy, which makes interpretation difficult. This prototype explores:

- **Wavelet-based signal denoising**
- **Feature extraction from time-series**
- **Multiclass classification using ML models**
- **Visual interpretation using Plotly and Matplotlib**

The project reflects my interest in bridging **signal processing**, **machine learning**, and **healthcare applications**‚Äîa key focus of the PhD program at Maastricht University.

## üß† Motivation

This repository is a self-initiated project created specifically for demonstrating my:
- Research curiosity in biomedical signal analysis
- Ability to design and prototype ML pipelines for complex, real-world data
- Technical skills in Python, signal processing, and interpretability
